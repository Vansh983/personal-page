        I try to conceptualize/come up with solutions using my technical skills.
        I am an avid reader and enjoy all genres of music. I like to participate
        in discussions involving tech and entrepreneurship. You will find me
        volunteering and helping others whenever I can. I believe in doing my
        best to give back to the society and bring a change.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can find some of my previous projects here and head over to LinkedIn
        to go through my experiences.
